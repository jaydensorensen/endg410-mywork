# W02-1 lecture 03
## Goals
Follow _Data Science Handbook_ Ch. 5  [Introducing Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.02-Introducing-Scikit-Learn.ipynb) (p.343-354) and work through:
The five steps:
1. Load and arrange data into feature matrix and target vector
2. Choose model class
3. Instantiate model
4. Fit model to data
5. Predict values for new data and evaluate results.

Repeat the 5 steps (above) for:
- Supervised regression
- Supervised classification
- Dimensionality reduction
- Clustering
